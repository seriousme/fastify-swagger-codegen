# Fastify swagger generator

This folder contains the [Fastify](https://fastify.io) Swagger generator plugin.
The plugin accepts a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) v2 specification object and
a service object that implements the operations listed in the swagger
specification. It will then configure Fastify to provide the routes listed in
the `specification` object and use the available JSON schema to validate
requests and responses. Valid requests will be handed to the methods with the
name of the operationId in the `service` object, if no method can be found the
plugin will insert a `not implemented` handler.


Standard AJV itself misses some format handlers so 
[ajv-oai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv-oai)
is being used as it adds the missing OpenApi formats.

For each route the parser has determines an `operationId`, either taken from the
swagger definition or generated by the parser.
